Presenting-Kinect
=================

Simulating an interactive whiteboard with Microsoft's Kinect.

###Notes on use

Set up the Kinect beneath the screen at which the projector is aimed.
The calibration phase defines a virtual screen in the air in front of the Kinect. To run calibration, type "calibration" in the command prompt. Indicate corners of "screen" by holding right hand still for ~2sec each time. Define corners in order bottom-left, top-left, top-right, bottom-right.
After calibration, Presenting:Kinect is ready to take pointer input.
Moving the right hand around 'on' the virtual screen will move the pointer accordingly. The user can 'click' by moving the left hand forward in front of the virtual screen. Moving the right hand in front of the virtual screen will click+drag.
